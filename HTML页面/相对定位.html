    <p>The morning sun filters through the dense canopy of ancient oak trees, casting dappled light on the forest floor. Dewdrops glisten on vibrant green ferns, each one holding a tiny reflection of the sky. A gentle breeze whispers through the leaves, carrying the earthy scent of moss and the sweet aroma of wildflowers. Somewhere in the distance, a woodpecker’s steady tap echoes, while songbirds chirp in a lively, melodic chorus.</p>
